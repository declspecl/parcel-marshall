/*trying this as well - STIN

Start from your currentLocation.

Find the closest destination.

Move there, then repeat â€” from that location.

Keep building the list until all destinations are used.

this is my idea to represent routes as home page just grabs closest location
they are pretty similar right now as updating the location would make home update button do the same thing
but this route update button is calculating the fastest route before you complete any destinations
this will most likely work more as intended with API data
