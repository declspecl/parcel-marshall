## Setup

Paste the Google Maps API key into `.env`. Look at `.env.example` to see the format, but it should look like this:

```
EXPO_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=...abc...
```

## How to Run

Run these commands:
1. `npm install`
2. `npm run start`

It will then be running on `http://localhost:8081`, available to browsers. Download the Expo Go app and scan the QR code in your camera app to open the app natively in your phone.
